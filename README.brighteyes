			Bright Eyes / (ehem. freeDSA)



This is a fork of DOSBox 0.74 with customiziations for "Das schwarze Auge - Die Schicksalsklinge" (aka "Realms of Arkania - Blade of Destiny").

The projects goal is to make that game runnable on newer computers,
with focus on:

*	logging	(show how the game makes decisions),
*	bugfixing (wipe out the last bugs to make the game ultra stable),
*	power consumption (let your laptop (or n900) not waste that much power, 	like running an unpatched DOSBox)

This is done by tracing function calls.
If a function is interesting for the gamer we print a logging output.
If we already know the exact behavior of a function, we can replace it.
E.g. instead letting DOSBox emulate a known decompression function
we decompress it on our own host processor (incredible fast)
and skip the emulation.


Prequisites:

*	the original game (currently the german CD V3.02, other may follow)
	(Bright Eyes will never run without the original.
	Make sure you own a copy of it.	DSA1 is no abandonware.)

*	at least one newer computer with an operating system
	like (Linux, BSD, MaxOS, Windows)

*	a toolchain for building DOSBox (C++ compiler, SDL, SDL_Sound),
	since atm no precompiled binaries are available.


Improvements and changes to the Original:

I could not resist to fix some Bugs in this early state.
